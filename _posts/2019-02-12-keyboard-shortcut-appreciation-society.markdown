How to get to that pesky "Do Refactor" button with the keyboard?

Welcome to today's edition of the **Keyboard Shortcut Appreciation Society** (KSoc (or KSAS)).

## Do Refactor

We love to refactor. If we don't refactor, our code slowly turns into unmalleable pulp.

Thank the heavens for IDEA's refactoring functionality. When refactoring, a pane opens with a **Do Refactor** button.
Since we want to not touch the mouse, ever, we hope for a keyboard shortcut. (And this on macOS no less.)

But alas! Nothing available in the keymap!

A quick search reveals a [post on the JetBrains forum](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206950395-MacOS-X-how-to-access-the-Do-Refactor-button-with-the-keyboard-?input_string=Shortcut%20for%20%22Do%20Refactor%22%20button%3F) 
that promises to resolve our situation.

And it does!

The famed keyboard shortcut is:
 
<kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>

You're welcome.
